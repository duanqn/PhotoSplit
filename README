The purpose of this project is to pack each person's photo into a seperate folder.

Motivation
=============
After a trip, you probably have hundreds of photos at your hands.
These photos include the ones you took for your friends, and of course you want to give them their photos.
However, picking someone's photos out can be very time-consuming.
That is why I want to develop this tool for myself and for you, to save our time and spend it on something more meaningful :)
